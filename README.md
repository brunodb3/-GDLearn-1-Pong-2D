# [GDLearn #1] Pong 2D Clone

This is the first entry on my personal challenge, the **GDLearn**. My goal is to upload at least one game to itch.io every month, on an attempt to learn about video game development using the Godot Engine.

Pong 2D Clone is exactly what you'd expect. A clone of a classic game with paddles and a ball.

Be aware this is a prototype made for learning purposes only.

## Controls

- Use "SpaceBar" to start the game (and to reset the ball to the middle if needed);

- Use "W" and "S" to control the paddle on the left;

- Use "Up Arrow" and "Down Arrow" to control the paddle on the right;

Enjoy!
